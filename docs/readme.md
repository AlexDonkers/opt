OPT is a modular extension of the ofo:Property class, described in the Occupant Feedback Ontoloty (https://w3id.org/ofo#). OPT can be used for specific use-cases related to indoor environmental comfort.

The ontology is intended to be used mainly for research activities and may be extended in the future based on use-case requirements. The author welcomes suggestions to extend OPT.
